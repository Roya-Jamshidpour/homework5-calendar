## Description
This is a daily scheduler app! The current date is displayed at the top of the page and with each changing hour the rows to input your daily tasks/plans change colors. Past hours display grey, the current hour displays red, and future hours display green. Type your daily tasks into each row and, if you click the corresponding save button, the app will continue to display that task even if you refresh the page!
